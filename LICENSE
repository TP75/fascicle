The a.m. page contains all the official versions of the European Union Public Licence (EUPL-1.2).  The preamble written for v 1.0, explaining the purpose of this Free/Open Source Software Licence, together with links to further information on the licence is valid for later versions.

The Joinup Licensing Assistant (JLA) may be worth a visit to compare software licenses:

The JLA is linked to SPDX (for Software Package Data Exchange), an initiative of the LINUX foundation that attempts to standardize the way in which organizations refer to software licenses: each licence is identified by a full name, such as "European Union Public Licence 1.2" and a shorter identifier, here "EUPL-1.2".
